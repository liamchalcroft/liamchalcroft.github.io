# Welcome to my academic website!

I am a final year PhD student at University College London, specializing in Machine Learning for Neuroimaging. My research focuses on creating robust representations to enable use of deep learning models in real-world open-domain settings. My PhD has focused on applying this goal to the task of segmentation of stroke segmentation in clinical MRI/CT data, under the supervision of [Prof. John Ashburner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UWi2lukAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Cathy J. Price](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gyfMndoAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Research Interests

- Domain generalisation
- Synthetic data
- Weak/unupervised learning
- Generative modelling
- Uncertainty estimation

My work aims to develop robust and generalizable machine learning models for medical image analysis, particularly in the context of brain pathology segmentation. This research has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment planning in clinical settings.

Currently, I am working on my PhD thesis, which explores novel approaches to domain generalization and synthetic data generation for 3D medical image segmentation. This includes developing convolutional attention models, implementing self-supervised learning techniques, and creating physically-constrained synthetic data frameworks to enhance the performance and reliability of deep learning models in real-world clinical scenarios.
