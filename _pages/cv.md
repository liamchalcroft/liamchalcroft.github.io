Profile
======
I am a PhD student specialising in Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis, with hands-on experience in both academic research and industry. I have a strong foundation in deep learning, computer vision, and medical imaging, complemented by practical experience in an AI startup. My work spans large-scale ML research, including 3D generative AI models and medical image segmentation. I am now seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise in machine learning to real-world challenges in applied research within academia, industry, or startups.
